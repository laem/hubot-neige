# Hubot Neige

Ask [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) for a succinct snow report for the ski resort of your choice.
Works with France and US resorts, thanks to the Skiinfo.fr and OnTheSnow.com websites.

This script is based on a scrapper, and would love to have access to [OnTheSnow's API](http://clientservice.onthesnow.com/docs/index.html) !
